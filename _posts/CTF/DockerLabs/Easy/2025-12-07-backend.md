**Machine by 4bytes**

---

### 1. Enumeration (Nmap)

I started by enumerating the machine to identify open ports and running services. I used the following command to scan all ports and detect service versions:

`nmap -p- -sV VICTIM_IP`

The scan results revealed two open ports: **SSH** and a **Web Server**. At first glance, the service versions did not appear to be vulnerable to any known exploits.

### 2. Web Server Analysis

I navigated to the web server, which presented a simple HTML login page.

I inspected the page source code to check for hidden credentials or comments, but I didn't find anything interesting. Since there was a login form, I suspected it might be vulnerable to **SQL Injection (SQLi)**.

### 3. SQL Injection

To test my theory, I used **SQLmap** to automate the injection attacks against the form. My goal was to dump the database, tables, and entries.

`sqlmap -u "http://VICTIM_IP" --forms --dbs --batch`

SQLmap confirmed that the page is vulnerable to **Time-Based Blind** SQL injection:

After dumping the user table, I found three users: "paco", "pepe", and "juan", along with their passwords:

### 4. SSH Access

Now that I had credentials, I decided to test them against the SSH service found earlier. I attempted to log in with the discovered users.

The user `pepe` was able to authenticate successfully, granting me initial access to the machine.

### 5. Privilege Escalation

To escalate privileges to root, I checked for binaries with the **SUID** bit set. SUID allows a user to execute a file with the permissions of the file owner (in this case, root).

I used the following command to find these files:

`find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null`

I noticed that the `grep` binary had the SUID bit enabled:

I also located a file named `pass.hash` in the directory. According to [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/grep/#suid), we can use SUID `grep` to read files we normally wouldn't have access to.

I used `grep` to read the contents of `pass.hash`:

To identify the type of hash, I used the `hashid` tool. It indicated the hash was likely **MD2** or **MD5**:

I used **John the Ripper** with the `rockyou.txt` wordlist and the format set to `Raw-MD5` to crack the hash. The password was revealed to be `spongebob34`.

Finally, I used `su root` and entered the cracked password to log in to the root account, achieving full system compromise.
