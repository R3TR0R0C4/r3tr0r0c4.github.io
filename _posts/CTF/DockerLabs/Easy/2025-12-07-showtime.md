### 1. nmap scan

Enumerate the machine and get all the important information.

By using the next command:

`nmap -sV -p- VICTIM_IP`

We can see 2 open ports with no version vulnerability

After visiting the website we can't see any aparent vulnerability, but there is a button to the login screen:

This is the login screen:

### 2. SQL injection

I'll execute sqlmap with the option `-u http://172.17.0.2/login_page/index.php` to indicate the target, and `--forms` to see the available html formularis.

After the analizing the site we can see that the login page is vulnerable to some attacks like boolean-based blind, error-based and time-based blind.

After this we can successfully try to use the option `--dump`:

After doing the same steps as before, we can execute the vulnerabilities and see three users with the passwords:

### 3. Using the stolen credentials

Let's try one of the credentials we've just gotten:

And successfully login:
