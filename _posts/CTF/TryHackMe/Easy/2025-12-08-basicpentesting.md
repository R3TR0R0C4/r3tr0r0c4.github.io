### 1. Nmap Scan
We'll use an intense scan of nmap on the victim IP to get the current services:

This is the default page that we can see:

![](assets/img/ctf/tryhackme/easy/basicpentesting/basicpentesting_2.png)

<br>

### 2. dirb enumeration

Following the clue of the hidden service on the machine, and also that there is nothing on the first page of the machine i'll use dirb to see what i can find:

The options I'll use are:
`dirb http://VICTIM_IP/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-1.0.txt`

We can see that we've found a `/development/` folder:

![](assets/img/ctf/tryhackme/easy/basicpentesting/basicpentesting_3.png)
   
Visiting this folder, we can see two files `dev.txt` and `j.txt`

This is the content of dev.txt:

![](assets/img/ctf/tryhackme/easy/basicpentesting/basicpentesting_4.png)

And this is the contents of j.txt

With this, we can extract that the machine is susceptible to a brute force attack and one of the user's username probably starts with a J.

<br>

### 3. SMB enumeration

With enum4linux, we can enumerate the contents and guess the users off of a SMB share, simply by indicating the target machine:

`enum4linux -m VICTIM_IP`

![](assets/img/ctf/tryhackme/easy/basicpentesting/basicpentesting_6.png)
    
After some time, we'll see that we've found the user `kay` and user `jan`:

<br>

### 4. SSH Bruteforce

Using hydra I'll attempt a brute force attack on the ssh service with the user `jan` as Kay has indicated it has a weak password:

After some time, I've found the password to be `armando`:

<br>

### 5. Privilege Escalation

First, I'll download linPEAS from [GitHub](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng)

Then set up a temporary web server with python:

![](assets/img/ctf/tryhackme/easy/basicpentesting/basicpentesting_10.png)

Since I want to transfer the script, I need a directory to place it in, for that I'll use `find / -writeable -type d 2>/dev/null` and i'll use the `/tmp` folder:

![](assets/img/ctf/tryhackme/easy/basicpentesting/basicpentesting_11.png)

Then with wget I can download the file:

![](assets/img/ctf/tryhackme/easy/basicpentesting/basicpentesting_12.png)

<br>

### 6. Vulnerabilities listing

Now let's execute linpeas:

![](assets/img/ctf/tryhackme/easy/basicpentesting/basicpentesting_13.png)

We can see user's Kay's ssh key that we can copy and use for ourselves:

![](assets/img/ctf/tryhackme/easy/basicpentesting/basicpentesting_14.png)

Then using `ssh2john` we'll make the ssh key usable for john:

![](assets/img/ctf/tryhackme/easy/basicpentesting/basicpentesting_15.png)

Using john the ripper, we can crack the public Kay key to get its password:

![](assets/img/ctf/tryhackme/easy/basicpentesting/basicpentesting_16.png)

Then we'll modify the key with read-write for the user, and import it with the key we got with john:

![](assets/img/ctf/tryhackme/easy/basicpentesting/basicpentesting_17.png)

<br>

### 7. SSH and get flag

And ssh into the machine with user Kay:

![](assets/img/ctf/tryhackme/easy/basicpentesting/basicpentesting_18.png)

We can list the contents of Kay's home and see the root flag on `pass.bak`:
