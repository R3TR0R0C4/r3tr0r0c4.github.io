### 1. Nmap Scan

Doing a nmap scan reveals a ssh service, wich is closed, and a web-server:

![](/assets/img/ctf/tryhackme/medium/mrrobot/mrrobot_01.png)

<br>

Visiting the website we see an intro video, and then a "shell" that gives some references to the series, nothing too useful at first sight:

<br>

### 2. Dirb scan

After a scan with Dirb, we can see the tipical `robots.txt` file:

![](/assets/img/ctf/tryhackme/medium/mrrobot/mrrobot_03.png)

<br>

### 3. First flag

After opening the robots.txt file there's an entry for `key-1-of-3.txt`:

![](/assets/img/ctf/tryhackme/medium/mrrobot/mrrobot_04.png)

After a scan with Dirb, we can see a `license` file, opening it shows some text, and after opening the inspect view, we can see our first flag:

![](/assets/img/ctf/tryhackme/medium/mrrobot/mrrobot_05.png)

<br>

### 4. Credentials

Visiting the `license` page in the webserver, and opening the inspect view, there is a hidden string:

![](/assets/img/ctf/tryhackme/medium/mrrobot/mrrobot_06.png)

<br>

After using an online decoder like [dencode](https://dencode.com), we see a username and password:

![](/assets/img/ctf/tryhackme/medium/mrrobot/mrrobot_07.png)

<br>

### 5. Wordpress access

Using the found credentials gets us into the wordpress admin page:

As user `elliot`, wich luckily is an administrator:

![](/assets/img/ctf/tryhackme/medium/mrrobot/mrrobot_09.png)

<br>

### 6. Reverse shell

As we have no access to the machine, i've installed a file explorer plugin:

![](/assets/img/ctf/tryhackme/medium/mrrobot/mrrobot_10.png)

<br>

With wich i've uploaded a php reverse-shell to the `wp-content/uploads/2024/06` folder:

![](/assets/img/ctf/tryhackme/medium/mrrobot/mrrobot_11.png)

<br>

Then set-up a nc listener, and visit the next url `http://mrrobot.thm/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/php-reverse-shell.php`

![](/assets/img/ctf/tryhackme/medium/mrrobot/mrrobot_12.png)

<br>

### 7. Second flag

After looking around the filesystem, in the robot's home folder we see a couple of files, `key-2-of-3.txt` wich we don't have permissions to open, and `password.raw-md5`:

![](/assets/img/ctf/tryhackme/medium/mrrobot/mrrobot_13.png)

<br>

This is the encripted password with MD5:

![](/assets/img/ctf/tryhackme/medium/mrrobot/mrrobot_14.png)

<br>

Wich we can crack with John the Ripper and the rockyou wordlist: `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`:

![](/assets/img/ctf/tryhackme/medium/mrrobot/mrrobot_15.png)

<br>

Now let's try to login as `robot` with the provided password, but first, since we're on a php reverse-shell i'll spawn a bash terminal with python, and then login:

![](/assets/img/ctf/tryhackme/medium/mrrobot/mrrobot_16.png)

<br>

And here we have the second flag:

![](/assets/img/ctf/tryhackme/medium/mrrobot/mrrobot_17.png)

<br>

### 8. Privilege escalation

I've tried using privilege escalation exploits, wich were unsuccessful, then I've tried to use SUID special permissions:

![](/assets/img/ctf/tryhackme/medium/mrrobot/mrrobot_18.png)

<br>

And nmap can be run in it's interactive mode as root:

![](/assets/img/ctf/tryhackme/medium/mrrobot/mrrobot_19.png)

<br>

Then I listed the contents of root's home, and found the last key:
